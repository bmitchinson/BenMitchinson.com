We're building Aisles Online Mobile using React Native, while simultaneously working on our REST API and it's GraphQL services. We're an agile team made up of 4 devs, 1 QA, 1 UI/UX Designer, PO, Tech lead, and 1 intern (ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„) with standards for TDD, 100% code coverage, and pair programming whenever possible. We're well on schedule to release our app on both iOS and Android in early June!

I'll be updating this post as my summer internship continues, but here's a look into everything I've been able to learn and contribute to the Hy-Vee Aisles Online App so far. The engineers on my team are *incredibly* talented, so learning from them has a privilege each and every day.

#### Week 1:
* Set the Mrs. Pac-Man High Score ðŸ‘¾
* Jumping into React-Native
* Completed Course on Redux 
* Implementing code with central immutable state
* Querying Graph QL using Apollo through dispatch calls
* Debugging using RN Investigator within AVD

#### Week 2:
* Writing a REST Endpoint to relay SQL Table data
* Creating a Graph QL Resolver for that endpoint
* Writing React Unit Tests using RTL
* Using Postman to test written API services
* Building Graph QL Queries
