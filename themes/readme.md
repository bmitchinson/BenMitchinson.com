### Additional Theme Download Required

This is in place of using a [git submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) in order to avoid locking the theme at a single commit.

Download [my fork](https://github.com/bmitchinson/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) of tranquilpeak to enable all features, or the [core repo](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) from @LouisBarranqueiro.

Place the clone inside of this `themes` directory, then from within the theme directory, run `npm install`, followed by npm start, to build the theme for use.

Be sure to update [config.yml](https://github.com/bmitchinson/BenMitchinson.com/blob/master/_config.yml) to reflect the name of your chosen theme for use.

Feel free also to experiement with other themes entirely if desired.
