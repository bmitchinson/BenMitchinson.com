The purpose of creating this site, and how I contributed to open source along
the way.
</br>
<!-- excerpt -->

# Objective
Use what I learned about javascript from my internship at 
[ISE](http://blog.iseinc.biz/meet-our-team-2018-summer-interns)
to create a blog / portfolio using a static site generator, hosted on github
with easy editing from anywhere.

### Beginning Approach
Before beginning my internship, I created a small site using only vanilla HTML +
CSS. It's funny to look back at it and consider how many unnecessary and 
completely inaccessible animations I chose to include.

With no version control and no templates, sure hosting was incredibly simple
([I used to host out of my personal dropbox account](https://droppages.com/)),
but nothing about the design allowed me to change content quickly, and the pages
were completely unresponsive on anything but one zoom level of desktop. 

### Fast forward
One year later, with a solid understanding of git and various JS frameworks, 
with some much better design choices on top, I began working on a site based on
[Louis Barranqueiro's] excellent hexo theme [Tranquilpeak].

Now my entire site output is hosted on the [gh-pages] branch with all code on 
[master] in an npm package.

* What I learned
  * Yellin at louis on slack
  * Engaging with other contributors for their features
* SC of first ever website with all the animations
* Overview of PRs made to the theme
  * Video larger one -> link to existing demo
  * Mention a few smaller ones () link contributions page

* Mobile view alongside desktop - Full span image ?
* Lighthouse score / accessibility -> through in a11y mention?
