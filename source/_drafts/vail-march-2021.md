What I've been doing at [Vail Systems](https://www.vailsys.com/) for the month of March.

## What I've worked on

- Using `ffmpeg-fluent` and ffmpeg to convert user uploaded audio to universal formats. How to convert and manage codecs and conversion.
- Updating our application to support uploaded audio in additional to in app generated. (Database -> GraphQL -> Client)

## What I've Learned (Technical)

#### Research on optimal GraphQL organization

#### Let GraphQL abstract the Database

Allows for flexibility if your resolvers will eventually source data from more than one source. Unless you're
willing to make consistent changes, having your schema align 1:1 with your database makes you miss out on the
abstractions offered by GraphQL.

I wish we would have promoted this by only resolving the fields we're going to use. We have resolvers

#### Using type predicates

#### Just break tests

Don't pull in more and more tickets until everything stays passing: "Don't be afraid to break stuff"

## What I've Learned (Personal)

#### Working from home -> move around the house

Moving my desk out of my room was great, but I find myself getting bored sitting there.
Moving to my bed to the couch to a new mini standing desk helps my mind not feel stuck.

#### Why is the house a mess

After work feeling stressed that dinner is ready or that my room is messy.

#### Realistic estimates, not best case

## What I'd like to improve (Technical)

#### Using UML is explore + explain ideas:

## What I'd like to improve (Personal)

#### Side tickets

Finding why they're valuable and remembering that goal.

Bundling -> need a drive to work on it

#### Creating tickets for experimentation efforts

I'm privileged to be on a team where we're able to take time and experiement with new ideas.
I've found that I sometimes give myself too many things to juggle: improving a jenkins step, adding a 
new cypress improvement, experiementing with a new build tool. I'd like to be sure that I'm creating
tickets for these efforts, so that they can be tracked + followed through on.

#### 26 files changed, pump the breaks.

Thats a sign that you need to slow down and reasses
