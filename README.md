Built using [my custom fork](https://github.com/bmitchinson/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) of Louis Barranqueiro's hexo theme [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak), using static site engine [Hexo](https://hexo.io).

#### Organization
More details to come soon, including a writeup on how I developed and organized the site. 

All files on the master branch are used as source files for Hexo to be able to build my website. The build is then deployed on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/bmitchinson/BenMitchinson.com/tree/gh-pages) branch.

[My fork of tranquilpeak]() is used as the theme of the blog in a submodule located under `themes/`.

#### Running the site locally
This is very easy to do, and a great way to learn hexo and it's common theme structure.

More details later, but essentially:
* `npm i` @ root dir
* `npm i` @ themes/bmitchinson_tranquilpeak
* `npm run-script build` @ themes/bmitchinson_tranquilpeak
* `hexo start` @ root dir

This gives you a version of the site at `localhost:4000` for tinkering and testing üëç
