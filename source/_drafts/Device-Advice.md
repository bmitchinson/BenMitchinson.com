### What we did this year

* pull from mailchimp (hours, look through random updates)

### Rebranding

* process + marketing students -> PDF / Presentation Materials?

### Updated Mission Statement

* insert quote statement like previous post

### New Executive Board

* list

I'll be leaving the executive board after three years of service to work on
personal [projects like these](/Current-Projects) and begin my job search. Although
I won't be able to have a direct impact on the leadership of the club, I'll still be 
volunteering regularly throughout the year.

### Future goals? Not really involved with that?

* More exec than normal, expanding senior home involvment with clear branding now
* Working with tech department at Oaknoll

### What I learned
I was able to learn lot about my own leadership tendencies while holding
the presidential position, as well as ways to help keep a team actively involved
in a common mission. ..... * tendencies to do things myself * giving others ownership

### How to get involved
