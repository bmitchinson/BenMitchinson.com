A page to demo my video tag [pull request](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak/pull/527) to the [tranquilpeak theme](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak/).</br>
Feature branch of my fork [here](https://github.com/bmitchinson/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak/blob/videotag)</br>
Documentation of the feature [here](https://github.com/bmitchinson/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak/blob/videotag/DOCUMENTATION.md)

# The Video Tag
The video tag supports any mp4 video, as it's widely accepted by modern web
standards over other video formats. [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

All code examples have a '-' placed before the opening %. 
This should be removed when using the code, as it's only included
to avoid placing videos within this post itself.


## Just a video with a caption
{-% video https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 a sample caption %}
</br></br>

{% video https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 a sample caption %}

## 'nocaption'
{-% video nocaption https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 This won't show %}
</br></br>
{% video nocaption https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 This won't show %}

## Percentage Width: '60%'
Height will scale accordingly

{-% video center https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 
60% Percent Width of 60 %}
</br></br>
{% video center https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 
60% Percent Width of 60 %}

## Alignment: 'left', 'right', 'center' (Default: left)

{-% video [left/center/right] clear https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% left caption %}
</br></br>
{% video left https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% left caption%}

{% video center https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% center caption %}

{% video right clear https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% right caption %}

## Extra div: 'clear'
Works as mentioned in the image tag + noted in the documentation. 'clear' is used in the right aligned video above, so that text doesn't overflow into the side. Not using clear in a small enough and side aligned video, allows for text to wrap around video. 

{-% video center clear https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% Clear %}
</br></br>
{% video center clear https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% Clear %}

## 'autoplay' (with 'mute') and 'loop'
The video will autoplay **as long as it's muted**. This is a standard from browser vendors in order to avoid annoying users.

{-% video center autoplay muted loop https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% 'autoplay' with 'muted' %}
</br></br>
{% video center autoplay muted loop https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% 'autoplay' with 'muted' %}

## Hide controls: 'nocontrols'
Right click on the video for controls. Useful when using
with autoplay and loop. Similar to using a gif within an image tag, except much more [web friendly and fast](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video/).
This purpose is the main reason for implementing the video tag.

{-% video center nocontrols autoplay loop muted https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% 
Controls off %}
</br></br>
{% video center nocontrols autoplay loop muted https://sample-videos.com/video123/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 50% 
Controls off %}

## Fig-20,25,... classes
Example usage of the fig-20,25... classes for automatic width. As noted in the
documentation, fig classes automatically override to float left. Use custom
width if ever needing to adjust the alignment in addition to custom size.
