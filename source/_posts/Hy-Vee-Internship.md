We're building Aisles Online Mobile using React Native, while simultaneously working on our REST API and its GraphQL services. We're an agile team made up of 4 devs, 1 QA, 1 UI/UX Designer, PO, Tech lead, and 1 intern (ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„) with standards for TDD, 100% code coverage, and pair programming whenever possible. We're well on schedule to release our app on both iOS and Android in June!</br>

I'll be updating this post as my summer internship continues, but here's a look into everything I've been able to learn and contribute to the Hy-Vee Aisles Online App so far. The engineers on my team are *incredibly* talented, so learning from them has been a privilege each and every day.
