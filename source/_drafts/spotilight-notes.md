I'm building a SPA to showcase your public spotify playlists across streaming 
services. Built open source without using any JS frameworks in an attempt to learn 
fundamentals the right way.

# [GitHub](https://github.com/bmitchinson/Spotilight) ‚óè [Live Demo](/Spotilight)

# Hosting
The app is hosted from within my hexo generated site[(Repo here)](). 
By creating a new hexo "page", I'm able to add a separate raw HTML page to my site,
and have it hidden from my blogs main index view. Planning on hosting multiple 
applications using this method, as they'll be available right from my site, 
with a seperate writeup to detail their development and implementation.

# Resources

# Other's Code:
* Spinners: http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/
* Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/console/

# Hosting your own:
All website code is available [here](github.com/bmitchinson/spotilight), with
instructions on how to host your own profile. I reccomend simple hosting on
something like  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

# Upcoming Features:
* [soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com) is easily the best way to convert playlists 
across streaming services. Their accuracy is really high and eventually they
want to offer an API, but as of now, it's not available. Until then, I don't
think converting playlists to other streaming services would really be possible :(

<!-- NOTES TO DELETE FROM POST -->

# Planned Features:
* "Spotlight Selection" for a pinned highlight of all music
*** Somehow store a backlog of all entries?
* Use of the Spotify API to pull all public playlists from a user.
*** This way, when the user updates their playlists, the site is dynamic.
*** Hopefully no scraping needed? Otherwise a daily scrape to update the site?
* Search all playlist names
* Cross Device Support
* Themed to look similar to Spotify's default page, but fast + fluid
* Development documented on benmitchinson.com
* Public analytics on your page, privately for me?

# Would be cool if:
* Apple music support, an API for converting playlists ?
*** Similar to switching between UI Dark + Light mode
* A way to host at benmitchinson.com, even tho that's currently a hexo build?
* Woah what about a "now playing" thing similar to discord's thing.
* Follow Playlists right from the SPA:
https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/1146
* Follow me as a user right from the site? Both Apple Music and Spotify? 
Soundcloud? Youtube? Tidal? Amazon Music?
* #playlistID -> Straight to that playlist view

# Questions:
* Playlist Folder Support?
* How to integrate the Spotify API? 
* Pagination of new pages on scroll 

# Steps:
[x] Create a site, hosted on benmitchinson.com, outside of the hexo index
[x] Explore how to develop that site and serve/(just open?) that site locally.
[x] Draft up all page interaction + design
[] Build small main page with demo images + playlist links (CSS Grid All Page View)
[] Test view naviagation, all on one page, with non url routing. (Refreshing brings you back to landing)

* Move CSS to a CDN
* Uglify to reduce size? Gulp bundling? Parcel?

######## Rate Limiting:
To reduce the amount of requests, use endpoints that fetch multiple entities in one request. For example: If you often request single tracks, albums, or artists, use endpoints such as Get Several Tracks, Get Several Albums or Get Several Artists, instead.

Note: If Web API returns status code 429, it means that you have sent too many requests. When this happens, check the Retry-After header, where you will see a number displayed. This is the number of seconds that you need to wait, before you try your request again.
